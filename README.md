🛠 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection
Raw XLSX file converted to CSV UTF-8
Verified for encoding, formatting, and missing values

2️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)
Handling missing values
Converting dates
Removing duplicates
Standardizing column names
Fixing data types (numeric columns, date columns, categorical columns)
Feature engineering (month, year, day, profit margin, etc.)

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales trends over time
Profit distribution
Category-wise performance
Regional insights
Customer-level analysis
Correlation heatmaps
Detecting outlier

4️⃣ SQL DataBase
Converting the Database.csv into MySQL database

5️⃣ Visualization & BI Dashboard
Created using Power BI:
Sales trends
Profit by category
Regional performance
Discount impact on sales
Customer purchase behavior

📈 Key Insights (Example placeholders)
These will update once your analysis is done:
X% of total revenue came from Category A
Region South/West/East had the highest profit margin
Discounts increased sales by Y%, but reduced profit by Z%
The last quarter of 2012 showed the highest demand
